# Detachable-Arduino-Based-Safety-Helmet-for-Motorcycle-Drivers
This is an open-source project that aims to improve the safety of motorcycle drivers by creating a detachable Arduino-based safety helmet. 
The helmet is designed to be easily attachable and detachable from the motorcycle's main body and includes several safety features, such as;

    1. Anti-theft Feature.
    2. Automatic Accident Detection.
    3. Automated SMS warning if accident is detected.
    4. Automated Alarm Activation.
    5. Easy access if the motorcycle key is lost.

Those are just it's main function and features, many additional features are included in the program.
